- **Author attribution** for every change
- **Timestamp tracking** with timezone support

### Version Comparison

Visual diff tools for understanding changes:

<CodeGroup>
```latex Version 1.0 (Yesterday)
\section{Introduction}

```

```latex Version 1.1 (Current)
\section{Introduction}
LaTeX is a powerful document preparation system
that provides excellent typography and precise
control over document formatting.
```

```diff Version Diff
\section{Introduction}
-LaTeX is a typesetting system.
+LaTeX is a powerful document preparation system
+that provides excellent typography and precise
+control over document formatting.
```
</CodeGroup>

### Named Versions

Create meaningful checkpoints:

```latex
% Version History:
% v1.0 "Initial Draft" - 2024-03-01
% v1.1 "Added Literature Review" - 2024-03-05  
% v1.2 "Methodology Complete" - 2024-03-10

## Best Practices for Team Collaboration

<Tip>
**Collaboration Guidelines**:

1. **Establish roles early** - Define who has editing vs. commenting access
2. **Use meaningful file names** - Keep the project organized for everyone
3. **Comment frequently** - Clear communication prevents misunderstandings
4. **Create regular versions** - Mark important milestones for easy reference
5. **Respect work in progress** - Check who's editing before making major changes
6. **Use consistent style** - Agree on formatting conventions upfront
</Tip>

### Team Workflow Patterns

**For Academic Papers:**
1. Principal investigator creates project and adds team
2. Each author works on assigned sections
3. Regular review cycles with comment-based feedback
4. Version control for submission iterations

**For Technical Documentation:**
1. Project manager sets up structure and permissions
2. Subject matter experts contribute content
3. Technical writers review and edit for consistency
4. Stakeholders provide feedback through comments

**For Student Projects:**
1. Team leader creates shared project
2. Each member responsible for specific sections
3. Peer review through comment system
4. Instructor access for guidance and grading

## Getting Started with Collaboration

1. **Create your project** or open an existing document
2. **Click "Share"** in the top toolbar
3. **Add collaborators** by email or shareable link
4. **Set permissions** appropriate for each team member
5. **Start collaborating** - changes sync immediately
6. **Use comments** for feedback and discussion
7. **Create versions** at important milestones
