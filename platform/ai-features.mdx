# AI-Powered LaTeX Features

LaTeX Cloud Studio integrates advanced AI capabilities to make LaTeX writing more intuitive and efficient. Our AI features help you write better documents faster while maintaining full control over your content.

<Info>
**Privacy First**: Our AI features are fully auditable and reversible. We never use your documents for AI training, and all suggestions can be reviewed before application.
</Info>

## AI Error Correction

### Intelligent Error Detection

Our AI automatically identifies and suggests fixes for common LaTeX errors before they cause compilation issues.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Syntax Errors" icon="code">
Catches missing braces, unclosed environments, and malformed commands
</Card>
<Card title="Reference Issues" icon="link">
Identifies broken cross-references and citation problems
</Card>
<Card title="Math Mode Errors" icon="square-root-variable">
Detects incorrect math syntax and suggests proper formatting
</Card>
<Card title="Package Conflicts" icon="triangle-exclamation">
Warns about incompatible packages and suggests alternatives
</Card>
</CardGroup>

### Auditable Corrections

Every AI suggestion is fully transparent:

```latex
% Original (with error)
\begin{itemize
\item First item
\item Second item
\end{itemize}

% AI Suggestion (with explanation)
\begin{itemize}  % Added missing closing brace
\item First item
\item Second item
\end{itemize}
```

<Tip>
**Review Mode**: All AI corrections are highlighted in the editor. Click any suggestion to see the explanation and accept or reject the change.
</Tip>

### Reversible Changes

- **One-click undo** for any AI correction
- **Change history** shows all AI modifications
- **Selective reversal** - undo specific changes without affecting others
- **Batch operations** - accept or reject multiple suggestions at once

## AI Citation Assistance

### Smart Citation Suggestions

The AI analyzes your content and suggests relevant citations from:

- **Your existing bibliography**
- **Common academic databases**
- **Similar documents in your project**
- **Recently cited works in your field**

### Citation Context Analysis

```latex
% You write:
Einstein's theory of relativity revolutionized physics

% AI suggests:
Einstein's theory of relativity \cite{einstein1905} revolutionized physics
% With tooltip: "Einstein, A. (1905). On the electrodynamics of moving bodies"
```

### Bibliography Management

The AI helps maintain consistent citations by:

- **Detecting duplicate entries** in your bibliography
- **Suggesting missing citation details**
- **Standardizing citation formats**
- **Identifying incomplete references**

<Warning>
Always verify AI-suggested citations for accuracy and appropriateness to your work.
</Warning>

## AI Paragraph Rewriting

### Style and Clarity Enhancement

The AI can help improve your writing while preserving technical accuracy:

<CodeGroup>
```latex Before
The experiment was conducted by us using the method described in the previous section and the results obtained were analyzed.
```

```latex After (AI Enhanced)
We conducted the experiment using the methodology outlined in Section~\ref{sec:methods} and analyzed the resulting data.
```
</CodeGroup>

### Tone Adjustment

Adjust writing style for different audiences:

- **Academic tone** - Formal, precise language for papers
- **Technical documentation** - Clear, instructional style
- **General audience** - Accessible language while maintaining accuracy

### Length Optimization

- **Expand explanations** for clarity
- **Condense verbose sections** while preserving meaning
- **Balance technical detail** with readability

## Smart Document Restructuring

### Automatic Organization

The AI analyzes your document structure and suggests improvements:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Section Organization">
```latex
% AI suggests reordering sections for better flow:
\section{Introduction}
\section{Literature Review}    % AI: Move before Methods
\section{Methodology}
\section{Results}
\section{Discussion}
\section{Conclusion}
```
</Tab>

<Tab title="Content Grouping">
```latex
% AI identifies related content for grouping:
\subsection{Data Collection}
\subsection{Data Processing}   % AI: Combine into "Data Management"
\subsection{Data Analysis}
```
</Tab>

<Tab title="Reference Placement">
```latex
% AI suggests optimal citation placement:
This phenomenon has been observed \cite{smith2020,jones2021}.
% AI: Move citation to sentence end for better flow
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Document Flow Analysis

The AI evaluates:

- **Logical progression** of ideas
- **Transition quality** between sections
- **Balanced section lengths**
- **Appropriate detail levels**

## Inline AI Editing

### Real-time Suggestions

As you type, the AI provides contextual assistance:

<CodeGroup>
```latex Command Completion
\begin{fig
% AI suggests: \begin{figure}[htbp]
```

```latex Environment Matching
\begin{equation}
E = mc^2
% AI suggests: \end{equation}
```

```latex Reference Suggestions
See Figure~\ref{
% AI suggests available figure labels
```
</CodeGroup>

### Smart Auto-completion

The AI learns from your writing patterns:

- **Personal style** preferences
- **Field-specific** terminology
- **Document context** awareness
- **Project-wide** consistency

### Contextual Help

Hover over any LaTeX command for AI-powered explanations:

```latex
\usepackage{amsmath}  % AI tooltip: "Provides enhanced math environments"
\begin{align}         % AI tooltip: "Multi-line equations with alignment"
```

## AI Configuration

### Customization Options

Tailor AI assistance to your preferences:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Suggestion Level" icon="sliders">
Choose from minimal, moderate, or comprehensive AI assistance
</Card>
