Let's create your very first LaTeX document! This guide will walk you through the essential steps to get started with LaTeX using LaTeX Cloud Studio.

<Info>
**Time needed**: 5 minutes  
**Prerequisites**: Access to LaTeX Cloud Studio  
**What you'll learn**: Basic document structure, compiling, and viewing output
</Info>

## The Simplest LaTeX Document

Every LaTeX journey begins with a simple "Hello World" document. Here's the absolute minimum you need:

<CodeGroup>
```latex hello-world.tex
\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
Hello World!
\end{document}
```
</CodeGroup>

That's it! These four lines create a complete LaTeX document.

## Understanding Each Line

Let's break down what each line does:

### 1. Document Class
```latex
\documentclass{article}
```

This tells LaTeX what kind of document you're creating. The `article` class is perfect for:
- Short documents
- Academic papers
- Reports
- General documents

Other common classes include:
- `report` - for longer documents with chapters
- `book` - for books with parts, chapters, and sections
- `letter` - for formal letters
- `beamer` - for presentations

### 2. Document Environment
```latex
\begin{document}
...content...
\end{document}
```

Everything between these commands is your actual document content. Think of it as the "body" of your HTML page.

## Creating a More Complete Document

Let's expand our document with common elements:

<CodeGroup>
```latex complete-first.tex
\documentclass{article}

% Preamble - setup goes here
\title{My First LaTeX Document}
\author{Your Name}
\date{December 2024}

\begin{document}

% Create title from preamble info
\maketitle

% First section
\section{Introduction}
Welcome to my first LaTeX document! This is an exciting moment in my journey to create professional documents.

\section{Why I'm Learning LaTeX}
I'm learning LaTeX because:
\begin{itemize}
    \item It creates beautiful documents
    \item It handles mathematics perfectly
    \item It's used by professionals worldwide
    \item It gives me complete control over formatting
\end{itemize}

\section{My First Equation}
Einstein's famous equation is $E = mc^2$, which shows the relationship between energy and mass.

\section{Conclusion}
This is just the beginning of my LaTeX journey!

\end{document}
```
</CodeGroup>

## How to Create This in LaTeX Cloud Studio

1. **Open LaTeX Cloud Studio** in your browser
2. **Create a new document** using the "New Document" button
3. **Copy and paste** the code above into the editor
4. **Click "Compile"** to generate your PDF
5. **View the result** in the preview pane

<Tip>
LaTeX Cloud Studio automatically saves your work and provides real-time preview, making it perfect for beginners!
</Tip>

## The Document Structure

A LaTeX document has two main parts:

### 1. The Preamble
Everything before `\begin{document}` is the preamble. This is where you:
- Set the document class
- Load packages (extensions)
- Define document information (title, author, date)
- Set up custom commands
- Configure document settings

### 2. The Document Body
Everything between `\begin{document}` and `\end{document}` is your content. This includes:
- Text
- Sections and chapters
- Equations
- Figures and tables
- References

## Your First Compilation

When you compile a LaTeX document, here's what happens:

1. **LaTeX reads your source file** (.tex)
2. **Processes the commands** and markup
3. **Generates a PDF** (or other output format)
4. **Shows any errors** if something went wrong

In LaTeX Cloud Studio, this happens automatically when you click "Compile" or enable auto-compilation.

## Common Beginner Mistakes

<Warning>
**Avoid these common errors:**

1. **Forgetting `\end{document}`** - Every document must end with this
2. **Content before `\begin{document}`** - Only setup goes in the preamble
3. **Mismatched braces** - Every `{` needs a matching `}`
4. **Wrong quotes** - Use `` ` ` '' for quotes, not " "
</Warning>

## Adding More Elements

### Comments
Use `%` to add comments that won't appear in the output:

```latex
% This is a comment
This text appears % but this comment doesn't
```

### Paragraphs
Leave a blank line to start a new paragraph:

```latex
This is the first paragraph. It can be as long as you want.

This is the second paragraph. LaTeX automatically handles spacing.
```

### Basic Formatting
```latex
\textbf{Bold text}
\textit{Italic text}
\underline{Underlined text}
\texttt{Monospace text}
```

## Practice Exercise

Try creating this document:

<CodeGroup>
```latex exercise.tex
\documentclass{article}
\title{My LaTeX Practice}
\author{[Your Name]}
\date{\today} % Automatically uses today's date

\begin{document}
\maketitle

\section{About Me}
% Write a paragraph about yourself

\section{My Favorite Formula}
% Add a simple math equation using $ $

\section{Things I Want to Learn}
% Create a list using \begin{itemize}

\end{document}
```
</CodeGroup>

## What's Next?

Now that you've created your first document, you can:

1. **Experiment with different document classes** - Try `report` or `book`
2. **Add more sections** - Use `\subsection` and `\subsubsection`
3. **Include mathematics** - Learn about math mode
4. **Format your text** - Explore fonts and styling
5. **Add images and tables** - Make your documents visual

## Quick Reference

| Command | Purpose | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `\documentclass{}` | Set document type | `\documentclass{article}` |
| `\begin{document}` | Start document content | Required |
| `\end{document}` | End document content | Required |
| `\title{}` | Set document title | `\title{My Report}` |
| `\author{}` | Set author name | `\author{Jane Doe}` |
| `\date{}` | Set date | `\date{\today}` |
| `\maketitle` | Create title block | Place after `\begin{document}` |
| `\section{}` | Create a section | `\section{Introduction}` |
| `%` | Comment | `% This is a note` |

## Tips for Success

<Tip>
1. **Start simple** - Don't try to use every feature at once
2. **Compile often** - Check your work frequently
3. **Read error messages** - They usually point to the exact problem
4. **Use templates** - Build on working examples
5. **Keep the documentation handy** - Reference it as you work
</Tip>
