No! LaTeX Cloud Studio runs entirely in your browser. We handle all the LaTeX installation, package management, and compilation on our servers. You just need a modern web browser and internet connection.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Is LaTeX Cloud Studio free to use?">
Yes, LaTeX Cloud Studio offers a free tier that includes:

See our [collaboration guide](/learn/latex/how-to/collaboration-workflow) for detailed instructions.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I work offline?">
Currently, LaTeX Cloud Studio requires an internet connection. However, we're developing offline capabilities that will allow you to:
- Edit documents offline
- Sync changes when reconnected
- Export projects for local editing
</Accordion>

## Getting Started with LaTeX

<Accordion title="I'm new to LaTeX. Where should I start?">
Great question! We recommend:
1. Start with our [LaTeX in 30 Minutes](/learn/latex-in-30-minutes) guide
2. Try our [Getting Started tutorial](/getting-started/cloud-studio)
3. Use our pre-made [templates](/templates) for common document types
4. Check out [beginner-friendly tutorials](/learn/latex/basics/creating-first-document)

LaTeX Cloud Studio is designed to make learning LaTeX easier with helpful error messages and AI assistance.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What's the difference between LaTeX and Word?">
LaTeX and Word serve different purposes:

**LaTeX excels at:**
- Professional typesetting and consistent formatting
- Mathematical equations and scientific notation
- Large documents (theses, books)
- Version control and collaboration
- Cross-references and bibliographies

**Word excels at:**
- Quick documents and letters
- WYSIWYG editing
- Track changes and comments
- Integration with Office suite

Many academics and professionals use both, choosing the right tool for each task.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I convert my Word document to LaTeX?">
While there's no perfect automatic conversion, here are your options:
1. **Manual conversion**: Copy text content and apply LaTeX formatting
2. **Pandoc**: Use this tool for basic conversions
3. **Start fresh**: Often it's easier to recreate the document in LaTeX

See our guide: [From Word to LaTeX](/blog/from-word-to-latex-beginners-journey)
</Accordion>

## Common LaTeX Questions

<Accordion title="How do I insert images in LaTeX?">
Use the `graphicx` package:

```latex
\usepackage{graphicx}
...
\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{image.png}
    \caption{Your caption here}
    \label{fig:mylabel}
\end{figure}
```

See our [complete guide to images](/learn/latex/how-to/working-with-images).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I create tables in LaTeX?">
Basic table example:

```latex
\begin{table}[h]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{|l|c|r|}
        \hline
        Left & Center & Right \\
        \hline
        Data & Data & Data \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Table caption}
\end{table}
```

For advanced tables, see our [tables tutorial](/learn/latex/tables-tabular).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I write mathematical equations?">
LaTeX has two math modes:

**Inline math**: `$E = mc^2$` produces $E = mc^2$

**Display math**:
```latex
\begin{equation}
    \int_{0}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}
\end{equation}
```

Learn more in our [mathematics guide](/learn/latex/mathematics/mathematical-expressions).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I manage bibliography and citations?">
Use BibTeX or BibLaTeX:

1. Create a `.bib` file with your references
2. Cite with `\cite{key}`
3. Add bibliography with `\bibliography{references}`

Full tutorial: [Bibliography and Citations](/learn/latex/bibliography-citations)
</Accordion>

## Troubleshooting

<Accordion title="Why won't my document compile?">
Common compilation issues:
1. **Missing packages**: Ensure all `\usepackage{}` commands are in the preamble
2. **Syntax errors**: Check for missing braces `{}` or brackets `[]`
3. **Undefined references**: Run compilation twice for cross-references
4. **Special characters**: Escape characters like `&`, `%`, `$` with backslash

Our [error fixing guide](/learn/latex/how-to/fixing-compilation-errors) covers solutions in detail.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I fix 'Undefined control sequence' errors?">
This error means LaTeX doesn't recognize a command. Common causes:
- Typo in command name (e.g., `\textbf` not `\txetbf`)
- Missing package that defines the command
- Command used outside its valid scope

LaTeX Cloud Studio's AI assistant can help identify and fix these errors automatically.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why are my figures appearing in the wrong place?">
LaTeX optimizes figure placement. To control positioning:
- Use placement specifiers: `[h]` (here), `[t]` (top), `[b]` (bottom)
- Try `[H]` with the `float` package for strict placement
- Use `\clearpage` to force all floats to appear

See [figure positioning guide](/learn/latex/basics/figures) for more control options.
</Accordion>

## Advanced Topics

<Accordion title="Can I create presentations in LaTeX?">
Yes! Use the Beamer package:
```latex
\documentclass{beamer}
\begin{document}
\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Slide Title}
    Your content here
\end{frame}
\end{document}
```

Check our [presentation templates](/templates/presentation) and [Beamer guide](/learn/latex/how-to/creating-presentations).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I use custom fonts in LaTeX?">
LaTeX Cloud Studio supports various font packages:
- `\usepackage{times}` for Times Roman
- `\usepackage{helvet}` for Helvetica
- `\usepackage{palatino}` for Palatino

For custom fonts with XeLaTeX/LuaLaTeX:
```latex
\usepackage{fontspec}
\setmainfont{Arial}
```

See our [fonts guide](/learn/latex/fonts) for comprehensive coverage.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I use LaTeX for languages other than English?">
Absolutely! LaTeX has excellent multilingual support:
```latex
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
\usepackage[spanish]{babel}
```

We support all major languages including Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, and more. See our [multilingual guide](/learn/latex/how-to/multi-language-documents).
